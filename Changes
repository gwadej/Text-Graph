Revision history for Text::Graph.

0.50  2014-04-28T18:30-0500
  - Modernize the layout of the module.
  - Modernize the code.
  - Remove unused get_line method.
  - Fix missing dependency on Text::Graph::DataSet, with test.
  - Code printed the data ignoring the minimum value, but calculated
    the length including it. I had intended the inclusion, but making the
    length calculation match the print was easier.
  - Thanks to Jerry D. Hedden for pointing out the previous 3 errors.
