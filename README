   Text::Graph

The Text::Graph package supports text-based bar and line graphs. I originally
created the package for scripts that provided a quick summary of log files. In
that application, a fancy, graphical graphing solution would have been overkill.

I used the earlier version of this module for years before deciding to add it
to CPAN. The new version has been rewritten to support an OO interface.

PREREQUISITES

Text::Graph only depends on Perl 5.

INSTALLATION

You can install Text::Graph using the normal perl module installation commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DOCUMENTATION

Each module in the package has its own POD documentation. The Graph.pm module
also contains some example code showing several different formatting scenarios.

SUPPORT

The Text::Graph module is only supported by me <wade@anomaly.org>.
